title: "The Uncertainty Principle and Fourier Analysis"
---

One of my favorite results in Fourier analysis is the **uncertainty principle**.

$$
\|x f(x)\|_{L^2} \, \|\xi \hat{f}(\xi)\|_{L^2} \geq \frac{1}{4\pi} \|f\|_{L^2}^2
$$

This expresses a deep tradeoff between the localization of a function and its Fourier transform.
